<p> At this point, you have already heard about Python strings and probably gained some experience using them. However, the Python <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15332" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a standard library is a collection of built-in modules that come pre-installed with the Python programming language. | These modules provide access to various useful functions and data structures, such as mathematical functions, string operations, and random number generation. The standard library is available on every system that has Python installed, making it a convenient and powerful resource for developers. Additionally, many widely-used algorithms can be found in the Python standard library or in external packages, providing ready-to-use functions for various problems.">standard library</a> also has the <code class="language-python">string</code> module that offers additional tools to work with strings. One way or another, programmers interact with strings rather often, so let's expand our knowledge about this Python domain using the <code class="language-python">string</code> module.</p>
<h5 id="constants">Constants</h5>
<p>Since <code class="language-python">string</code> is a module, we need to import it first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import string</code></pre>
<p>The first tool we are going to look at is the <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15332" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string constant is a type of string that contains a specific set of characters, such as punctuation marks, digits, or uppercase English alphabets. | The string module in the Python standard library provides predefined string constants that consist of ASCII characters and can be used for membership tests. These string constants are useful when you need to compare a character in a string to a specific set of characters. Additionally, the string module offers other tools such as template strings for string formatting and a function to capitalize each word in a string.">string constants</a></strong>. They are basically strings that contain a certain type of characters — punctuation marks, digits, uppercase English alphabet, and so on. The <code class="language-python">string</code> module employs ASCII characters only. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is one of the character encoding standards used in electronics.</p>
<p>Below is a table with the names and contents of every <code class="language-python">string</code> module constant:</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><th><p>Name</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th><th><p>Contents</p></th></tr><tr><td style="width: 25%;"><p><code class="language-python">string.ascii_lowercase</code></p></td><td style="width: 40%;"><p>the lowercase English alphabet</p></td><td style="width: 35%;"><p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.ascii_uppercase</code></p></td><td><p>the uppercase English alphabet</p></td><td><p>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.ascii_letters</code></p></td><td><p>the concatenation of <code class="language-python">ascii_lowercase</code> and <code class="language-python">ascii_uppercase</code></p></td><td><p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.digits</code></p></td><td><p>numbers from 0 to 9</p></td><td><p>0123456789</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.octdigits</code></p></td><td><p>digits used in the octal number system that can represent any number with 8 digits</p></td><td><p>01234567</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.hexdigits</code></p></td><td><p>digits used in the hexadecimal number system that can represent any number with 16 digits</p></td><td><p>0123456789abcdefABCDEF</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.punctuation</code></p></td><td><p>a set of characters for punctuation marks</p></td><td><p>!"#$%&amp;\'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.printable</code></p></td><td><p>the printable Python ASCII characters – <code class="language-python">digits</code>, <code class="language-python">ascii_letters</code>, <code class="language-python">punctuation</code>, and <code class="language-python">whitespace</code></p></td><td><p>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!"#$%&amp;\'()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \t\n\r\x0b\x0c</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-python">string.whitespace</code></p></td><td><p>the whitespace ASCII characters – a space, a tab, a linefeed, a return, a formfeed, and a vertical tab</p></td><td><p>'\t\n\r\x0b\x0c</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>We can access them with a simple command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(string.ascii_letters)
# 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

print(string.digits)
# '0123456789'
</code></pre>
<p>You can use these constants to check whether a character of interest belongs to one of the groups above, to remove or add the characters from your strings, or to distinguish them in someone else's code. Let's say you've written a calculator and want to test if the input contains only digits. To do that, you can use a membership operator <code class="language-python">in</code> that will return a boolean value <code class="language-python">True</code> if your item is in the sequence or <code class="language-python">False</code> if otherwise:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">user_input = input('Enter one digit: ')  # '5'

print(user_input in string.digits)  # True</code></pre>
<h5 id="the-helper-function">The helper function</h5>
<p>There is only one <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15332" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a helper function is a function that is used to perform a specific task, usually as a part of a larger function or a main program. | It is called a helper function because it helps the main function or the main program to perform its task more efficiently and/or more readably. Helper functions are often used to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, making the code more structured, reusable, and easier to understand. They can perform a variety of tasks, such as data validation, data processing, or calculations, and they can take inputs and/or return outputs.">helper function</a> in the module: <code class="language-python">string.capwords(s, sep)</code>. It capitalizes each word in a string. You can also provide your own separator; the default value is a space:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_str = "the string i want to capitalize"
print(string.capwords(my_str))  # 'The String I Want To Capitalize'</code></pre>
<p>What is considered a "word" depends on the separator — it may be everything in between:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_other_str = "another,string,i,want,to,capitalize"

print(string.capwords(my_other_str, sep=","))  # 'Another,String,I,Want,To,Capitalize'
print(string.capwords(my_other_str))  # 'Another,string,i,want,to,capitalize'</code></pre>
<p>In the first case, the separator is a comma, so each piece of text between the commas is capitalized. In the second case, the separator is a space, so there's only one "word" that is capitalized.</p>
<h5 id="formatting">Formatting</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-python">string</code> module also offers a few advanced ways to format string. For instance, you can customize your own string with the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Formatter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Formatter</a> class. The ability to change the default way of formatting is very useful but quite specific, so we won't consider these things in the topic, but you're more than welcome to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">learn</a> about them yourself. </p>
<p>Anyway, we will take a look at <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15332" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a template string is a tool used for string formatting, allowing you to create a string template to fill in later. | They are particularly useful when you need to generate the same string with a few differences, such as in a greeting.

The string formatting method can also be used to format object(s) into a string using the `str()` method.">string formatting</a>. As the name suggests, it can create string templates to fill them in later:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_template = string.Template("Hello, $name!")
my_str = my_template.substitute(name="Jack")
print(my_str)  # 'Hello, Jack!'</code></pre>
<p>Pretty convenient, right? You can use them if you want to generate the same string with a couple of differences, for example, for greetings.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have learned a little more about Python strings by investigating the <code class="language-python">string</code> module from the standard Python library. It has predefined string constants with groups of characters that can be used for membership tests. It contains the <code class="language-python">string.capwords()</code> function that capitalizes each word in a string which can be beneficial sometimes. And, finally, this module suggests several advanced ways to string formatting. Hopefully, you'll find this new information useful in practice. Speaking of which, let's resolve some challenges! </p>
